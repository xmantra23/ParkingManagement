Logical errors and debug process for project 4:

error 1: I forgot to make the JTextArea scrollable as a result some of the output was not
         being shown in the window.Fixed it by correctly adding a JScrollPane to the text
         area

error 2: For one of the user panels search button I forgot to register the JButton as a 
         result when I clicked on the button nothing was happening.I had correctly 
         implemented the event handler but because of forgetting to register it wasn't 
         doing anything. Checked the code again and found that the button was not registered
         .Registered the button properly with the correct handler and the button was working
         properly

error 3: I forgot to properly implement a code for JCheckBox when it was unchecked as a result
         after the JCheckBox was checked it displayed the correct output but when unchecked it 
         still was displaying the pervious output. Realized that I needed to reset the JText
         area once the checkbox was unchecked. Did so an now it is properly clearing the screen
         when unchecked.


total time spent for project 4: 28 hours.
